# odin-calculator

This is a final project of Odin's foundations course. 
In this project, I'm going to make a fully-functional web-calculator
The calculator is going to contain such functions as:
    Add
    Substract
    Multiply
    Divide
    SquareRoot
    Power
    Factorial
    Clear and delete buttons

TBD: CONNECT SCREEN KEYS TO KEYBOARD
